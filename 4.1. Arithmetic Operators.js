a = 10
b = 20
add = a + b     // Adding a and b                   30
dif = a - b     // Subtracting b from a            -10
product = a * b // Multiplying a and b              200
div = a / b     // Dividing a by b                  0.5
mod = a % b     // Remainder after a divided by b   10

/*
We can add 2 or more strings also
*/
a = "Java"
b = "Script"
add = a + b // Adding Java and Script will result "JavaScript". There will be no space between the added strings.
