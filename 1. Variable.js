/*
In this first file of JavaScript tutorial, we will learn about variables, the most core concept of any programming language.

Variables are placehders or containers for values. As the name suggests, the value stored inside variables can be changed.

To declare Variables in JavaScript, we need to use the keyword "let", followed by a variable name. Then we put the equal to sign or the assignment operator, followed by the value the variable should hold.[ let (variable name) = (value) ]
*/
let user = "Abhishek" // The variable user will hold the value "Abhishek".
/*
There are some rules for creating variable names.
  1. A variable name can include alphabets, numbers and 2 special characters, $ and _
  2. A variable name can start with alphabets and the 2 special characters.(They can't start with numbers) [ 1name is an incorrect variable name]
  3. Variable names should be sensible(OPTIONAL). [ a, b, c, x, etc. should not be used as variable name]
*/

/*
The value stored in variables can be changed. Let's understand how.
To change the value of a variable, use the following syntax:-
(variable name) = (new value)
*/
user = "Tiwari" // The variable user will now hold the new value "Tiwari"
